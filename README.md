<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

### Project Scope

A DDoS attack targets websites and servers by disrupting network services in an attempt to exhaust an applicationâ€™s resources. The perpetrators behind these attacks flood a site with errant traffic, resulting in poor website functionality or knocking it offline altogether. These types of attacks are on the rise.

DDoS attacks are wide-reaching, targeting all sorts of industries and company sizes worldwide. Certain industries, such as gaming, ecommerce, and telecommunications, are targeted more than others. DDoS attacks are some of the most common cyberthreats, and they can potentially compromise your business, online security, sales, and reputation.

* User should be able to select type of attack he/she wants to simulte.
* The attacked server/service should not be availaible after the attack.

## Project Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/DDoS Arechitecture.jpg" alt="architecture Diagram" >

> Above diagram shows how DDOS attack is simulated.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a type of DOS attack where multiple systems, which are trojan infected, target a particular system which causes a DoS attack. 

A DDoS attack uses multiple servers and Internet connections to flood the targeted resource. A DDoS attack is one of the most powerful weapons on the cyber platform. When you come to know about a website being brought down, it generally means it has become a victim of a DDoS attack. This means that the hackers have attacked your website or PC by imposing heavy traffic. Thus, crashing the website or computer due to overloading. 

### Built With
